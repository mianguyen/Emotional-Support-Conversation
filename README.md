## Data

The corpus file is `ESConv.json`. We have collected **more** conversations with more topics. ESConv now contians 1,410 conversations with 10 topic problems.

## Model Implementation

We provide two versions of model implementation:

- `codes` is the version that we used in the original experiments
- `codes_zcj` is the version reproduced by  [@chujiezheng](https://github.com/chujiezheng) based on the repo [chujiezheng/UniModel (github.com)](https://github.com/chujiezheng/UniModel)
